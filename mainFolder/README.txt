When updating MiniBot to a new version, make sure not to delete the mainFolder. This folder contains all your important files, such as your saved data (e.g., custom interactions, to-do lists, local password manager) and settings, which are essential for MiniBot to work properly. To update, simply download the new version of MiniBot.exe and replace the old MiniBot.exe file in the mainFolder with the new one. This way, you keep all your existing data safe while upgrading MiniBot to the latest version. Following this simple process ensures a hassle-free update without losing any of your important files or progress.
